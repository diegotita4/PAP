# Quantitative Analysis and Allocation (QAA)


## Description

This project represents a meticulous and systematic exploration in the field of Quantitative Asset Allocation (QAA). Its central objective is to conduct the backtesting of QAA strategies using historical data, evaluating and optimizing investment portfolios. Through a detailed analysis, the aim is to identify assets efficiently aligned with the investment profiles of clients and investors, considering various criteria and strategic objectives. The specific focus on backtesting QAA strategies aims to discern the most effective methodologies for portfolio optimization, evaluating their historical performance under diverse market conditions. This approach will empower investors to make informed decisions regarding the composition of their portfolios, achieving a balance between risk and expected return in line with their specific investment profiles and objectives.


## Install dependencies

*Install all the dependencies stated in the requirements.txt file, just run the following command in terminal:*

        pip install -r requirements.txt
        
*Or you can manually install one by one using the name and version in the file.*


## Functionalities

The functionality of the project is based on various stages to ensure a comprehensive and effective approach. It begins with a clear definition of the project, where primary and secondary objectives are established. The research and documentation are carried out thoroughly, encompassing key concepts, QAA strategies, and optimization models. Next, the code is developed, applying the QAA strategies and optimization models defined earlier.

The code implementation is done explicitly, utilizing object-oriented programming (OOP) and avoiding external libraries to ensure a clear understanding of the process. Subsequently, a dashboard is created for results analysis, providing a visual tool that facilitates data interpretation and monitoring of the implemented strategies.

In addition to the mentioned steps, the project incorporates detailed documentation of the QAA strategies used, as well as the models and optimization algorithms employed. This approach ensures complete transparency in the process and provides a solid foundation for future evaluations and improvements.
